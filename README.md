## 🎯 Why I’m Interested in This Role

I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a technology consulting team at PwC.  
I worked on a project to map out a project plan for upgrading a client's compliance system. I practiced client discovery and user stories and built my product roadmap skills in a real-world context.  
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on client project management, and I’m excited to apply these skills on a technology consulting team at a company like PwC.
