You’ve gone through the client discovery workshops, created sample user stories for each requirement, and developed a roadmap to deliver an upgraded enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the international manufacturing company. Now you are tasked with putting it all together. At the end of a client engagement, there is a final presentation with the client to share key findings, goals and timelines. Your job is to create the executive summary slide for your team.

This is a very important slide in the final presentation deck because it summarizes what the team has accomplished. While the other slides will provide more detail, many client executives will turn to the executive summary slide and share it with their team. Associates are often tasked with creating the structure and content of important slides as a way to learn and also provide value to the team.

In this task, the template is already created for you, but on an actual project, you will have to create the template structure yourself. PwC has resources, former project slides and templates to help you build a slide, but there are times when you may have to get creative when developing your slide.

Using the template provided in the resources below, develop the content for a summary slide for the final client meeting. Think through the various tasks you worked on, the project brief, and project goals as you create the slide. Be as clear, succinct and precise as possible, because client executives may not have a lot of time to read through heavy text.

This will integrate the various tasks you have already submitted. You can use the model answers from the previous tasks to help you fill in the content for this assignment. Once you’ve populated the content in the PowerPoint slide, submit it below as a PDF file.
